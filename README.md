# LeetCode Solutions - C++

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems implemented in C++.

Currently included problems:

| Problem # | Problem Name | Description                              |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| 067       | Plus One     | Increment an integer represented as an array of digits |

## How to Use

- Each problem has its own `.cpp` file, e.g., `067_PlusOne.cpp`.
- You can compile and run the solutions using a C++ compiler like g++ or clang++.
- Example compile and run commands:

```bash
g++ 067_PlusOne.cpp -o plusone
./plusone
